# Advent of Code 2018

2018 was my second year of Advent of Code. I used [Mathematica](https://wjholden.com/aoc/2018/), which was an extremely mixed experience. Mathematica excelled for a very few puzzles, but in general I found it poorly suited for many of the procedural programming puzzles. It was definitely a learning experience. Now, eight years later, I'm finally picking up where I left off, this time using Rust.

  This is *much* faster than insertions.
