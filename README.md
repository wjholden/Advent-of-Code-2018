# Advent of Code 2018

2018 was my second year of Advent of Code. I used [Mathematica](https://wjholden.com/aoc/2018/), which was an extremely mixed experience. Mathematica excelled for a very few puzzles, but in general I found it poorly suited for many of the procedural programming puzzles. It was definitely a learning experience. Now, eight years later, I'm finally picking up where I left off, this time using Rust.

- https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/a4i97s/comment/ebepyc7/ `VecDeque` can rotate!
  This is *much* faster than insertions.
- Are you seeing crazy $x$ and $y$ scales like the below plot (generated by Plots.jl)?
  There might be something in your dataset causing your data to be interpreted
  as strings and not numbers.
